ORG_GEO.PY

Example of using nltk and spacy libraries to identify and get the organizations and geographic names from a text.
NOTE: there is actually no particular need for nltk here, spacy can do the tokenizing too. So it is actually an overkill to use both libraries. 
- You can do a lot more with spacy, check https://spacy.io/ .
- Same with nltk. Check https://www.nltk.org/ .
