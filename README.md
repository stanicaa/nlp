# nlp
Various NLP examples. This is a vast area, current repository is meant to only provide simple examples to prove capabilities to get you started on learning the libraries. There is no such thing as out of the box solution, so it really depends on what your goal is. The main libraries we highly recommend learning are: nltk (to get started), spacy (excellent library) and gensim (the workhorse for vector models), tensorflow (for neural network based models like seq2seq and so on). There are a lot more libraries out there, and we will flag some of them below as we use them.

ORG_GEO.PY
- Example of using nltk and spacy libraries to identify and get the organizations and geographic names from a text.
- NOTE: there is actually no particular need for nltk here, spacy can do the tokenizing too. So it is actually an overkill to use both libraries. 
- You can do a lot more with spacy, check https://spacy.io/ .
- Same with nltk. Check https://www.nltk.org/ .
